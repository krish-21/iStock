###Problem Statement

Finance is the most important economic sector in Hong Kong. Understanding finance in quintessential to all Hong Kongers.

Finance is broadly divided into 3 primary areas :

    1. Corporate Finance
    2. Investments
    3. Financial Markets & INstitutions

There are 4 different types of Investments each with distinct characteristics, risks and benefits :

    1. Stocks
    2. Property
    3. Cash
    4. Fixed Interest

A crisp explanation of Stocks and Stock Markets :

•The stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided. - Wikipedia

•A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses.

Investors around the world study the stock market for several years, and still, none of them has quite mastered it completely.

Anton Chekhov, one of the greatest writers of short fiction in history, has rightly said **"Knowlege is of no value unless you put it into practice"**

This lack of mastery even after several years of practice could be quite a scary situation for investors who are new to the market.

How do investors practice stock trading without actually putting in some money?

This problem is solved by our program **iStock**, a stock market simulator (written in C++).

**iStock** is a program which will let you buy and sell stocks of 5 tech giants : Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook & Amazon.



### Problem Setting

Problems faced by Investors :

    1. No comprehensive portofolio available detailing the stocks owned, credit balance and other important information.
    2. How to set a credit limit to avoid overspending.
    3. How to efficiently look up the transaction history

##Program Features

...........Have to write features..............

## Building and Running the Program
We have made using the program a rather simple task for anyone with a Unix-based terminal. Just follow the following instructions, and execute these commands in order. However, you are required to have [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git), [g++ compiler](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs250PreTest/latest/Public/installingACompiler/), and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

Clone this github repo.

`git clone https://github.com/krish-21/iStock.git`

Go into the project root directory.

`cd iStock`

Build the main program using make. *Our makefile defaults to compiling main.cpp.*

`make`

Start running the program.

`./main`
