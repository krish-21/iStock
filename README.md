#Stock Trading 
### Note : This project is still under development ###

## Problem Statement : 

Finance is the most important economic sector in Hong Kong. Understanding finance is an enormous and cumbersome task. 

So we are here to help you out with one small part of it, Stocks!

Here are two boring Wikipedia definitions on Stocks and Stock Markets :

•The stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided. - Wikipedia
•A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses.

These explanations seem a tad boring. Don't lose faith though!
